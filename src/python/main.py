# THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS KNOWLEDGE BASE
# =============================================================================
# This is NOT a restricted tag list - it's a semantic knowledge base for
# inferring what the sermon is ABOUT. The embedding model finds concepts that
# are semantically similar to the sermon content, even if the exact words
# never appear in the sermon.
#
# Example: A sermon about "following Jesus" and "denying self" will match
# "Discipleship" because the MEANING is similar, even though "Discipleship"
# is never spoken.
#
# Each entry is: "ConceptName - clarifying description"
# The description helps the embedding model understand the concept precisely.
